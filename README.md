BITE-Server.net
===============

This is a .Net implementation of a server for the Google open source BITE-Project

NOTE: You will need a custom build of the Chrome BITE extension in order to test BITE-Server.net.  A sample build is included in the /Extension folder of this repo.  If you load it into Chrome as an unpacked extension (using developer mode), you'll be able to point the BITE client to http://localhost:60054 for testing.  For now, Dev & Production channels are set to this url.
